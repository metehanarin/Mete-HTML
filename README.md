# High School English Grammar Progression

This repository contains an interactive HTML page that serves as a grammar checklist. Below is a quick reference of all topics covered.

## Grade 9 (B1 → early B2) – “Clean-up & Consolidate”
- Core tense review: present/past simple-continuous, present perfect (both aspects), past perfect, basic future forms (will / be going to / present continuous)
- Conditionals 0–2 (real, unreal; if / unless / in case …)
- Simple passive (all main tenses)
- Relative clauses (defining vs. non-defining; who / which / that)
- Modal verbs for obligation & advice (must, have to, should, ought to, need to)
- Modals of ability & permission (can, could, may, be allowed to)
- Gerund vs. infinitive – starter set (like V-ing, want to V)
- Comparatives, superlatives, degree modifiers (far, much, by far)
- Question & tag-question formation
- Adverbs of frequency / manner / place
- Basic phrasal verbs (put on, take off, look after)

## Grade 10 (B2 plateau) – “Stretch & Specify”
- Perfect continuous forms (present & past)
- Future continuous & future perfect
- Passive across tenses + have/get sth done
- Reported speech (statements, questions, commands; sequence of tenses)
- Modals of deduction & speculation (must / can’t / might — present & past)
- Third conditional + Intro to mixed ("If I had studied, I would be …")
- Relative-clause upgrades (whose, preposition+ whom, where/when)
- Participle clauses (present & past) as reduced relatives
- Gerund / infinitive advanced patterns (verb + object + to-inf / V-ing)
- Quantifiers & determiners (each/every, both, either/neither, little/few vs a little/a few)
- Used to / be used to / get used to
- Phrasal & prepositional verbs surge (pick up on, come up with…)
- Linkers & discourse markers @ B2 (however, therefore, in spite of)

## Grade 11 (B2⁺ → early C1) – “Academic Lift-Off”
- Advanced conditionals & full mixed sets (past → present & present → past)
- Inversion for emphasis (Never have I…, Not only did they…, So rarely do we…)
- The unreal past (wish / if only / it’s (high) time / I’d rather)
- Causative structures (have / get sb to V; have / get sth done)
- Reporting passive & impersonal passive ("It is believed that…")
- Nominalisation & noun-phrase packing (decision, implementation of…)
- Fronting & cleft sentences (What I need is…, The person who…)
- Modals + perfect aspect (should have V-ed, might have V-ed, needn’t have V-ed)
- Advanced relative devices (all of whom, the majority of which)
- Participle-clause chains & absolute constructions
- Discourse-level cohesion (reference, substitution, ellipsis)
- Idiomatic phrasal verbs & collocations (set out to, take issue with)
- Academic discourse markers (moreover, nonetheless, consequently)

## Grade 12 (C1 target) – “Precision & Power”
- High-level inversion (Hardly / Scarcely / No sooner)
- Advanced emphasis (do/does/did + bare infinitive)
- Complex noun-phrase architecture (multiple pre- & post-modifiers)
- Non-finite clause mastery (-ing, past-participle & infinitive clauses with own subjects)
- Conditional alternatives (were I to…, should you need…, on condition (that)…)
- Subjunctive & formulaic expressions (It is essential that he be…)
- Ellipsis & substitution for academic style (so do I; neither does she; do so)
- Advanced modal nuances (shall for legalese, dare/need as semi-modals)
- Pragmatic grammar (hedging, stance: appears to…, is likely to…; concession: much as…, albeit)
- Register & style shifts (formal vs informal; avoiding contractions; whom/whose)
- Discourse-level tense control (future-in-the-past, narrative tense-shift)
- Phrasal-verb idiomaticity at C1 (bail out of, zero in on, bear down on)
- Lexical bundles & academic collocations (it remains to be seen whether, play a pivotal role in)
- Grammar for referencing sources (integral vs non-integral citation forms)
